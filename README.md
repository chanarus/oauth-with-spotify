# Spotify-App

This is a sample app to search spotify tracks. For this I have used react client and the provided auth server from the spotify.

## Setup the project

- Clone the project from the repository
- Run 'npm run dev-install' to install all the dependencies in both client and auth server
- Run 'npm run dev' start both servers.
